## WeChat Officials Account

### Introduction

- WeChat, which is Chinese WhatsApp, is the most popular social software in China. Almost everyone spends a lot of time on it every day, including reading on official accounts, so it is necessary to set up a Zeitgeist official account.

- Build up Zeitgeist's WeChat Official Account. 
- I have noticed that there is **no** WeChat official account about the prediction market so far, so we can **do a related content promotion**.

### Analysis

  The average number of views on this official account is around 419. Publish articles three times a week, a total of 3 article.

### Summary

As I have analyzed above, after careful operation of a famous public blockchain, the number of fans of WeChat public account can reach about 40,000, and the reading amount of each article can be from several hundred to one thousand. Of course, this depends on the labor and time cost.
Since there is no official account about prediction market at present, we can expand our content scope for WeChat official account, not limited to the promotion of Zeitgeist, but also introduce some articles about prediction market, futarchy, DAO and on-chain governance.

### Three-Month Goal

- The number of fans of WeChat official account reach about 2,000.
- The reading amount of each article reach about 250.

## WeChat Official Group

### Introduction

- WeChat groups are also necessary for promotion in China.
- Build up Zeitgeist's WeChat Official groups. It is convenient for Chinese Zeitgeist enthusiasts to have daily discussions.

### Analysis

## Telegram Chinese Community

### Introduction

- Since Chinese WeChat groups may be monitored by the government, causing some data leakage, and some sensitive topics involving finance may cause the group to be banned, so a Telegram Chinese community is also necessary.

## BiHu Bar

### Introduction

Bihu is a Chinese Quora community focusing on the blockchain industry. It is also active in China and has a certain credibility. So we need to create a Zeitgeist BiHu bar to have a place to discuss and promote.

### Analysis

### Summary

- Most of the participants in BiHu are token investors. They are more willing to discuss the token price and official subsequent operation. At the same time, they are also willing to promote for the community for some rewards.

### Three-Month Goal

- BiHu followers reach 1,000 

## Live Promotion

#### Introduction



#### Analysis

- **rebase Community**

  rebase is a Web3 developer community in China, which is pretty famous and active.

  This is its WeChat Official Account:

  ![image-20210428182012073](/home/whisker/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20210428182012073.png)

  And this is its Live video, here is the [link](https://space.bilibili.com/382886213/video):

  ![image-20210428194419797](/home/whisker/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20210428194419797.png)

#### Summary

Rebase community is a blockchain open source community organized by Chinese developers. It publishes daily newspapers and recommends articles every day. At the same time, it also holds online live broadcast project analysis from time to time (usually once or twice a week). I think this is a very good, very hard-core technology-oriented community, which will contribute a lot to the promotion of Zeitgeist in China. If we can attract more developers to Zeitgeist, this will greatly help our ecological development.

#### Three-Month Goal

- Perform one or two live broadcasts related to Zeitgeist and prediction markets.

## Follow-up development

Since this is only a three-month plan, there are some other promotion methods that cannot be carried out at the same time, but these are also what I hope to carry out in the future.

- ### Hackathon && Meetup

  Hackathon and Meetup are very popular geek communication platforms in the world today. This is also what we need to do, because only by attracting enough developers can the ecology of Zeitgeist develop fast enough.
  I have the experience of participating in many Meetups, and I have a good relationship with the Nervos team who has held many Meetups. If the development goes well, I can hold a Meetup within three months.

  Of course, Meetup will not be launched soon, because we first need to accumulate more online resources to make people familiar with our project, so that the Meetup will be meaningful.

- ### Forum

  Although we have many forms of community, I think the existence of forums is also necessary.
  First of all, the BiHu community can attract more investors. They pay more attention not to the technology itself, but to the interests, so they cannot make members loyal enough. The ChainNews and WeChat public accounts are mainly for the promotion of more formal information. The existence of WeChat groups makes it easier for Chinese community members to communicate, but due to the nature of WeChat, new members will not be able to see the previous discussion records, so the existence of the forum will make up for this. New members can search the past Posts for a better understanding of the project itself.

  There are some forums examples:

  - **Nervos**

- ### Podcast

  Podcast is a form of community communication that I really like. People can listen to podcasts while traveling to absorb new information and knowledge. I think it’s a very meaningful thing to make a successful podcast.

  Here are 2 podcasts that I really enjoy.

  - [Fork it](https://forkit.fm/)
  - [Zero Knowledge](https://www.zeroknowledge.fm/)
