## WeChat Officials Account

### Introduction

- WeChat, which is Chinese WhatsApp, is the most popular social software in China. Almost everyone spends a lot of time on it every day, including reading on official accounts, so it is necessary to set up a Zeitgeist official account.

- Build up Zeitgeist's WeChat Official Account. 
- I have noticed that there is **no** WeChat official account about the prediction market so far, so we can **do a related content promotion**.

### Analysis

As you can see in the image below:

### Summary

As I have analyzed above, after careful operation of a famous public blockchain, the number of fans of WeChat public account can reach about 40,000, and the reading amount of each article can be from several hundred to one thousand. Of course, this depends on the labor and time cost.
Since there is no official account about prediction market at present, we can expand our content scope for WeChat official account, not limited to the promotion of Zeitgeist, but also introduce some articles about prediction market, futarchy, DAO and on-chain governance.

### Three-Month Goal

- The number of fans of WeChat official account reach about 2,000.
- The reading amount of each article reach about 250.

## WeChat Official Group

### Introduction

- WeChat groups are also necessary for promotion in China.
- Build up Zeitgeist's WeChat Official groups. It is convenient for Chinese Zeitgeist enthusiasts to have daily discussions.
